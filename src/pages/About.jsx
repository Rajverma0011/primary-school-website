          <h3>Founded with Vision</h3>
          <p>
            R.K. Public School was founded in <strong>2012</strong> by <strong>Late Ramphere Kurmi</strong>,
            a visionary educationist who believed in the transformative power of quality education.
            With the motto <em>"Education for Enlightenment,"</em> our school was established with the
            mission to provide value-based education to the children of Basti and surrounding areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located in Sikandarpur, near PP Petrol Pump in District Basti, Uttar Pradesh, our school
            has been serving the community for over a decade, nurturing young minds and building
            future leaders through comprehensive education.
