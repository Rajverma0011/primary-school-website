# ðŸ“¸ Guide: Adding Real School Photos from Facebook

## Overview
Your website currently uses high-quality placeholder images that represent the type of content suitable for a school website. To make it authentic, you'll need to replace these with actual photos from your Facebook page.

## Facebook Page Reference
**Your School's Facebook Page**: https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064106820772

## Steps to Add Real Photos:

### 1. Download Photos from Facebook
1. Visit your Facebook page
2. Go to the Photos section
3. Download high-resolution versions of:
   - School building exterior
   - Classrooms and smart boards
   - Science laboratory
   - Computer lab
   - Students in activities
   - Sports ground/playground
   - Cultural events
   - Award ceremonies
   - Independence Day celebrations
   - Staff photos

### 2. Optimize Images
- **Format**: Use WebP or JPEG format
- **Size**: Optimize for web (800-1200px width)
- **Quality**: 80-90% compression for good balance

### 3. Upload to Your Project
Place images in the `public/images/` folder with descriptive names:
```
public/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ school-building-exterior.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ smart-classroom-1.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ science-lab.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ computer-lab.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ sports-ground.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ independence-day-2024.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ cultural-event.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ principal-km-shukla.jpg
â””â”€â”€ staff-group-photo.jpg
```

### 4. Update Image References

#### Homepage Hero Background:
File: `src/components/home/Hero.jsx`
```jsx
// Replace line 8:
backgroundImage: `url(/images/school-building-exterior.jpg)`
```

#### Gallery Images:
File: `src/pages/Gallery.jsx`
Replace the `src` values in the `schoolPhotos` array:
```jsx
{
  id: 1,
  src: "/images/school-building-exterior.jpg",
  alt: "School Building Exterior",
  caption: "R.K. Public School Main Building - Sikandarpur, Basti"
}
```

#### About Page Gallery:
File: `src/pages/About.jsx`
Update the `aboutGalleryImages` array with real photo paths.

#### Staff Directory:
File: `src/components/about/StaffDirectory/StaffDirectory.jsx`
Replace placeholder staff photos:
```jsx
photo: "/images/principal-km-shukla.jpg"
```

### 5. Recommended Photo Categories:
