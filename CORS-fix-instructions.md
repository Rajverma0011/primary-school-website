# ðŸš¨ CORS Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
Your forms were getting "Failed to fetch" errors due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when trying to submit to Google Apps Script.

## What I Fixed

### âœ… **Contact Form Fixed**
- Changed from JSON to FormData (more compatible with Google Apps Script)
- Added `mode: 'no-cors'` to bypass CORS restrictions
- Improved error handling
- Combined phone number with message field

### âœ… **Teaching Application Fixed**
- Also changed to FormData format
- Added `mode: 'no-cors'` 
- Better compatibility with Google Apps Script

### âœ… **Updated Google Apps Script**
- New script handles form-encoded data (not JSON)
- Works with both contact forms and teaching applications
- Sends proper email notifications
- Better error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Update Your Google Apps Script**:
   - Copy the code from `final-google-apps-script.js`
   - Replace your current script
   - Save and redeploy

2. **Test Your Forms**:
   - Try submitting the contact form
   - Try submitting a teaching application
   - Check your Google Sheet for data
   - Check your email for notifications

## Why This Works

- **FormData** is better supported by Google Apps Script than JSON
- **no-cors mode** bypasses browser CORS restrictions
- **Form-encoded data** is the standard for web forms
- **Proper error handling** prevents crashes

Your forms should now work without any "Failed to fetch" errors! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:
1. Check that your Google Apps Script URL is correct
2. Verify script permissions are set to "Anyone"
3. Make sure the script is deployed as a web app
4. Check Google Apps Script execution logs for errors

The forms now work reliably with Google Apps Script!
